# Automatic-No-touch-Trash-Can-CCAI_321
Automatic no-touch Trashcan​  The idea is to use sensor to detect objects ​  (for example person) when the person comes near the trashcan it will open directly using motors that help this process and it will close when the person finishes throwing the trash automatically.
