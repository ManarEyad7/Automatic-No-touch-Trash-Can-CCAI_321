# Automatic No-touch Trashcan (CCAI_321)

## Overview
The Automatic No-touch Trashcan project aims to create a hands-free trash disposal system. By incorporating sensors and motors, the trashcan can automatically open when a person approaches and close once the trash has been deposited.

## Features
- **Sensor Detection:** Utilizes an Ultrasonic Sensor to detect the presence of objects, such as a person, in proximity to the trashcan.
- **Motorized Lid:** Equipped with a Servo Motor to facilitate the automated opening and closing of the trashcan lid.
